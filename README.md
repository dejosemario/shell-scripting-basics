# shell-scripting-basics
This project is a simple command-line To-Do List application written in Bash. It allows users to manage their tasks from the terminal with an interactive menu. All tasks are saved in a file named todo.txt located in the user's home directory (~/todo.txt), making it easy to persist task data between sessions.

## Fixtures
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks with numbered lines
- Delete tasks by number
- Interactive menu system 
- Persistance storage in `~/kodecamp/todo.txt`

## Screenshots and Demonstrations

This screenshot demonstrates the application's startup interface that appears when users execute the script. The first image shows the main menu with four numbered options for task management operations. The second image illustrates the empty state response when selecting "View all tasks" (option 1) on an uninitialized todo list, displaying the message "No tasks found. Your todo list is empty".
